  - title: Detecting Fake News for Reducing Misinformation Risks Using Analytics Approaches
    authors: Chaowei Zhang, Ashish Gupta, Christian Kauten, Amit V. Deokar, Xiao Qin
    year: 2019
    venue: European Journal of Operational Research
    description: |
      Fake news is playing an increasingly dominant role in spreading misinformation by influencing people’s perceptions or knowledge to distort their awareness and decision-making. The growth of social media and online forums has spurred the spread of fake news causing it to easily blend with truthful information. This study provides a novel text analytics–driven approach to fake news detection for reducing the risks posed by fake news consumption. We first describe the framework for the proposed approach and the underlying analytical model including the implementation details and validation based on a corpus of news data. We collect legitimate and fake news, which is transformed from a document based corpus into a topic and event–based representation. Fake news detection is performed using a two-layered approach, which is comprised of detecting fake topics and fake events. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through the implementation and validation of a novel FakE News Detection (FEND) system. The proposed approach achieves 92.49% classification accuracy and 94.16% recall based on the specified threshold value of 0.6.

  - title: A Perception Augmentation System for Autonomous Vehicles
    authors: Christian Kauten, Ashish Gupta, Xiao Qin, Han Li, David Bevly and Alison Jenkins
    year: 2018
    venue: Pre-ICIS SIGDSA Symposium
    description: |
      We describe a system prototype for perception augmentation in autonomous vehicles. The system is built using a fully convolutional deep encoder-decoder architecture to map pixels with depth measures to semantic class labels. Class labels recombine with depth measures to produce a 3-dimensional semantic map of the objects in front of the vehicle. The map, simplified to highlight areas of importance (e.g., other vehicles, pedestrians), is shown to the passenger using a novel user interface. The map is also analyzed for potential risks to queue alerts to the passenger. Alerts are both: (1) shown to the passenger using an addressable LED strip around the windshield, and (2) delivered to the passenger through a speaker.

  - title: "REDUX: Managing Renewable Energy in Data Centers using Distributed UPS Systems"
    authors: Xiaopu Peng, Christian Kauten, Thomas Heckwolf, Chaowei Zhang, Jianzhou Mao and Xiao Qin
    year: 2018
    venue: IEEE International Conference on Smart Cloud
    description: |
      To environmental friendly and energy-efficient data centers, it is prudent to leverage on-site renewable sources like solar and wind. Distributed UPS systems are deployed in data centers to handle the intermittency feature of renewable energy. We propose a renewable-energy manager called REDUX, which offers a smart way of managing server energy consumption powered by a distributed UPS system and renewable energy. REDUX maintains a desirable balance between renewable-energy utilization and data center performance. REDUX makes judicious use of UPS devices to allocate energy resources when renewable energy generation is low or fluctuating condition. REDUX not only guarantees the stable operation of daily workload but also reduces the energy cost of data centers by improving power resource utilization. Compared with existing strategies, REDUX demonstrates a prominent capability of mitigating average peak workload and boosting renewable-energy utilization.
